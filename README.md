# State of the Art RD Packages For Python

These packages are a work in progress, but are an attempt to create a wrapper to implement a wrapper for the wonderful RD packages found here (https://sites.google.com/site/rdpackages/rdrobust) which utilize R or Stata, so that they can be used in Python.

Use of the programs requires all of the following packages in Python:
1. `rpy2` for running R in Python
2. `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for producing high quality graphics
3. `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and dataframe reading

Additionally, you need to have the original `rdrobust` installed in R (you can find this in the provided link).

Hopefully I will make these better in the future, but for now let me know if you spot any bugs.
